# Jaze Maze Game

This maze game project was developed as part of CSSE2002 (Programming in the Large), which focuses on key concepts and techniques in modern programming languages, particularly in java. 
These concepts are designed to adhere to best practices in software development, ensuring:
- Reliability
- Maintainability
- Scalability

From this project/course, I learned, practiced and formalised my understanding of essential skills and best practies, such as:
- OOP: structuring software using classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to improve code organisation and reusability.
- Error handling: Contract & defensive programming, exception handling
- Testing: JUnit testing, blackbox & whitebox testing
- Design Principles: SOLID principles, cohesion & coupling, law of demeter
- Modern java: Lambda expressions, functional interfaces & method reference, streams, generics

In this project I tried to apply what I learned!
