 * Represents an interface for maze file operations.
 * This interface provides a contract for loading mazes from files and converting them into a 2D character array.

 * A typical maze file:
 * - Begins with the dimensions of the maze (width and height).
 * - Followed by the maze data, with characters representing walls, paths, start, and end positions.

 * Note: Implementing classes should handle various validation scenarios and throw the appropriate exceptions as detailed in the {@link #load(String)} method.

     * This method attempts to read a maze file with the following expectations:
     * - The first line should contain the maze's dimensions, separated by a space (e.g., "10 15").
     * - Subsequent lines should provide the maze data with specific characters representing the maze elements.

     * Exception Handling:
     * - Throws {@link MazeMalformedException} if the maze data doesn't match the given format.
     * - Throws {@link MazeSizeMissmatchException} if the maze data doesn't match the specified dimensions.
     * - Throws {@link IllegalArgumentException} for other general validation errors, such as invalid characters.
     * - Throws {@link FileNotFoundException} if the specified maze file is not found.

     * @throws IllegalArgumentException     For other validation errors.
     * @throws FileNotFoundException        If the maze file is not found.
